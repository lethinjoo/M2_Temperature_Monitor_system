## Abstract

Now a days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors. The Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In my project, the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature. In my project I have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and LCD diplay,etc.
